# purity-and-danger
Explorations of frame overlap in viral discourse and xenophobic discourse.

## alternative approaches notes

* mataphor project might have some overlap
    * virus metaphors applied to society
* similar to K means clustering --> takes all points in the embedding into account
* Instead, use a Bayes/Gaussian mixture (like L1 regularization) --> filters out features of embedding that aren't relevant
    * distance from centroid
* combine supervised data with unsupervised data
* categories = medical contagion, pre-covid contagion, post-covid contagion
* we are interested in anomoly detection - new uses of language post-covid
* Need to find examples of uses of these metaphors
    * small set of example sentences that contain metaphors of contagion applied to social groups or otherness
    * small set of examples sentences that contains metaphors of contagion NOT applied to social othering

Could we just use the Allen corpus to look at increased frequency of language like foreigner
